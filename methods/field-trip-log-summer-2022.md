# HIMB field trip log summer 2022

### June 6th 2022 - August 20th 2022

> Daily Tips: HIMB Lilipuna parking and pier gate code is 3246. Apparently it’s always the same 4 numbers, but they switch the order up occasionally. 

I departed Seattle and arrived in Honolulu with 2 bags of personal gear, 1 large husky tote, and 1 small dry-shipper. The husky tote weighed 75lbs, and was over the 50lb limit. The Alaska Air fee for overweight gear was $70. The tote and dry-shipper were both considered ‘oversized’. I was surprised at the airport by my Dad and Auntie, who fit all of the gear in the back of a Subaru Crosstrek and took me to get a poke bowl at Nico's on pier 38! I later went grocery shopping at Foodland in Kāne'ohe and my Dad dropped me off to make a rendezvous at the Lilipuna parking lot and pier with Ariana Huffmyer and Jill Ashey from the Putnam Lab. After a brief kerfuffle trying to find the right gate code, we all loaded the gear up on the ‘ferry’ (a 14ft skiff!) driven by an RA, and motored over to HIMB. I dropped personal gear and groceries in my dorm room at the Hinalea, and dropped lab gear in the newly renovated Pauley lab 112a&b. I ended the day with a brisk walk around the island, unpacked my bags, and stashed my groceries in one of the Hinalea fridges.

> Daily Tip: The low vine ground cover near the blue tanks has stinging nettles! Wear garden gloves when pruning… 

I started the day by assessing the tanks, shelter frame, and tank platform. One tank was already in use to grow algae, the other 15 were upside down and covered in old leaf litter. Of note was the rusting condition of the shelter frame, which had lost a corner vertical pole entirely, leaving a rusty joist angled down near face-level which we nicknamed the ‘tetanus spear’. I learned that the sand filter for the water was broken, and the water coming through the pipes was raw from the bay. Ariana, Jill, and I then spent a sweaty hour generally cleaning up the place. Fritz, one of the lead facilities managers, lent us a leaf blower, large pruning shears, and a pair of broad push-brooms. We discovered many of the cinder blocks used to prop up the blue tanks had been ‘repurposed’ (stolen, some may say). There were 36 cinder blocks missing. We had enough cinder blocks to set up 6 tanks (enough for the Putnam Lab’s needs) and enough PVC elbow connectors to set up stand-pipes for drainage, but we needed more. Once 6 tanks were up and water was flowing, I continued to push-broom the remainder of the platform and weed and prune back the overgrowth from the invasive mangroves that were encroaching on the tank platform and shelter. We also visited the ‘creepy-closet’ and recovered the JPG-lab gear stored there, moving it all to the ‘new old poly’ lab 112. We ended the day with a short trip to Kailua for a swim!

> Daily Tip: HIMB facilities managers arrive at 7am and wrap up their workday at 2pm. 

Started the day by walking over to the workshop near the lighthouse to talk to HIMB facilities staff Fritz about the cinder blocks. He said that they didn’t have any that were unused, and encouraged me to buy some from City Mill hardware store in Kāne'ohe. He told me I could go to the office to check out the white HIMB truck parked at Lilipuna to go get them (spoiler alert, I can’t because I’m not a UH employee and the UH insurance doesn't extend to visiting researchers).  Instead, I was introduced to my HIMB sponsor Ku’ulei at her lab on the point. She ushered me inside and made me feel very welcome and was extremely kind and generous. She arranged to have her research technician Andrew pick me up in his personal truck and take me to City Mill. We hand loaded all 36 cinder blocks into the back of his Tacoma PreRunner! I forgot to eat breakfast, so I treated us both with some poke bowls for an early lunch. After, we met Fritz, Troy, and Luke at the He’eia Kea Boat Harbor. They had brought over the landing craft vessel and a forklift to pick up some other shipments, and we were able to time it Troy, talking about Alaska and boats the whole way. Once back at HIMB, they used the forklift to bring the pallet of cinder blocks right to the tank platform, where I set them out and spray-painted them with a little JPG-Lab marker. Federica arrived today! Ariana picked her up from the airport while I was out dealing with the cinder blocks. Jill’s large FedEx shipment of equipment also arrived. I helped shuttle gear back and forth from the lighthouse to the lab, and I ended the day by catching up on this log, and submitting some receipts for reimbursement.

##### Friday 06/10/2022

> Daily Tip: HIMB is all about who you know… Also it is useful to have a paper clip or hairpin to reset the Apex system!

 King Kamehameha Day! Hawaiian State Holiday, so everybody is off!Except for us… and Ku’ulei. I slowed down a bit today and simply went through the boxes of gear and compared their contents to the [HIMB Creepy Closet Inventory](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UdUgZ3InWl0HgHCUwtQaIBPcOXYm0jkd9lAEFNRc8sQ/edit). I highlighted what I found in green, and what I did not find I highlighted in red. The lids were literally locked closed, so I don’t know how they got in there, but **most of the bins had mice droppings** over everything. Many of the items were slightly wet, with a weird moist sticky texture. I didn’t really want to unpack and stash things in cabinets without being able to properly wash everything, so I simply left it at that for today. I attempted to connect with Ku’ulei in person; she had invited me to stop in at her lab and ride out on their boat for a snorkel while they deployed settlement substrate. I visited her lab twice, but no luck. Both times I stopped in she was out on the reef. I did spy **16 unused small glass aquariums on a shelf outside Ku’ulei’s lab** that would be perfect for my glass settlement chambers. I made a mental note next time I do see her to ask if anybody had plans to use them... I did recover the Z-fix, pointed out to me by one of her students. It’s now in lab 112a in the cabinet under the sink. It’s corrosive, but **we don’t have any chemical storage cabinets in 112a (another question for JPG & Ku’ulei? What do we do for chemical storage?**). The rest of the day I generally helped Ariana and Jill with a few basic setup things for their ‘squaricles’ and header tanks. The header tanks are set up in chest coolers and filled by a [livestock float valve](https://www.amazon.com/Trough-Matic®-Stock-Water-Tank/dp/B000B4GTPK/ref=sr_1_3?gclid=Cj0KCQjw-pCVBhCFARIsAGMxhAfqxPY8P3DJ3LgQ9sYTHapmPnSLyKWmti9ChSQh9baMiHsAdcGj6h0aAt69EALw_wcB&hvadid=385023619896&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=9032766&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=e&hvrand=15386426078298807836&hvtargid=kwd-584993332798&hydadcr=16356_9865272&keywords=livestock+water+trough+float+valve&qid=1655015524&sr=8-3). The chest coolers will be manipulated for temperature by Ariana and Jill’s Apex system with heaters. Another chest cooler will also be manipulated for acidity by Federica’s CO2 bubbler. Toward the end of the day I was approached by someone from the Ford group and told that **the water line that supplies our blue tanks and the water line that supplies the Coral Resilience tanks is the same**, and they noticed their water flow was way down when ours were running. I told the person to talk to Ariana, and she and Ford seem to have worked it out. We called it a day early at 4pm and went over to Makai Beach with Ariana and the Ford Lab group for a grill out and a swim. Afterwards, we returned and Jill and Ariana showed me the Apex system as they did troubleshooting to reset it and connect it to the HIMB WiFi.

> Daily Tip: Download WhatsApp! We’re using it to group text because Federica has an international phone, and it works great. Jill has dubbed this field season #spawngirlsummer. Lookout…

Written by [Sarah Tanja](mailto:stanja@uw.edu): Kicked off the day with a trip to Kane’ohe Pancake House at 8am for a breakfast out. Jill loves pancakes, and the mac nut waffle with whip cream was pretty heavenly. Ariana dropped Jill, Federica and I at Safeway to grab some groceries while she went to the hardware store. I purchased cleaning supplies for the creepy closet gear (with a plan to request purchase approval after the weekend). We spent a large portion of the day at the tanks, where I made 6 individual shade-cloths for tanks using 1” PVC pipe, PVC straight connectors, [PVC snap clamps](https://www.amazon.com/White-Snap-Clamp-Inch-Inches/dp/B00AIE89CY/ref=asc_df_B00AIE89CY/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=193142362025&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=12000454515498972614&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9032766&hvtargid=pla-308320622760&psc=1), zip-ties, [pony clamps](https://www.amazon.com/Professional-Plastic-Backdrop-Photography-Improvement/dp/B08RXW32H4/ref=sxin_13_pa_sp_search_thematic_sspa?content-id=amzn1.sym.a1dd6248-8b51-4ef7-9dfb-d3cf41015b4b%3Aamzn1.sym.a1dd6248-8b51-4ef7-9dfb-d3cf41015b4b&cv_ct_cx=pony+clamps&gclid=Cj0KCQjw-pCVBhCFARIsAGMxhAfS2htYCEyIEbJ7iJ4iwNfW-qxQl0gz6SDtcET1ABzi-uXzQ6kF3RcaAhIREALw_wcB&hvadid=177805266466&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=9032766&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=e&hvrand=12563825568108167339&hvtargid=kwd-176420902&hydadcr=1607_9901437&keywords=pony+clamps&pd_rd_i=B08RXW32H4&pd_rd_r=abe9e1c5-d294-4b27-9803-fd73e6e27863&pd_rd_w=MATiP&pd_rd_wg=WUMxG&pf_rd_p=a1dd6248-8b51-4ef7-9dfb-d3cf41015b4b&pf_rd_r=ND86VGN3MH9EQK90Y0NK&qid=1655016534&sr=1-4-a73d1c8c-2fd2-4f19-aa41-2df022bcb241-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExMUZGTkw4UE9VR081JmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwOTcyOTU2MlJJRkxBRjFWQldNQyZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUExMDEwNDg1WDFDNU5LRDVUMExVJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3Bfc2VhcmNoX3RoZW1hdGljJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==), and the shade cloth material [come back and add link to that stuff…]. I cleaned and added the 1” threaded elbow connectors and the 1” PVC stand-pipe to the tank outflow for the 6 tanks we will use for adult bead feed treatments. I helped set up the shade tent for the humans as well! In attempting to get all the cables to reach where they needed to go, we realized that **2x4 boards are supposed to lay across the cinder blocks to support the tanks**… something we did not put on the tanks that Ariana and Jill had already set up. We will have to go back and empty those tanks and add 2x4’s to them to prevent sagging. Jill focused on the Apex system. Current ‘issue’ is that **the temp probe cables cross the main walking path between the tank columns at ankle height and are a bit of a tripping hazard**. We will try to optimize this over the next few days, either by moving the location of the power strip or moving the blue tanks closer together. Once the Apex system was up and running, we went and collected *Pocillopora acuta !* Ariana selected the colonies and removed them from the reef with a small ball hammer and narrow chisel. Jill recorded via GoPro (and it automatically made this [cute highlight reel](https://photos.app.goo.gl/R1tLCTocDYDsMybH9)!), Federica placed two HOBO loggers on the reef flat, and all three of us swam colonies back to the shallows between the Ford lab and the broken down bungalow attached to the Hinalea. Once all the corals were gathered up in the shallows, we shuttled them in 5 gal buckets of seawater back to the tanks. The *P. acuta* are brooders, so they release live larvae. These colonies we collected today will be the ‘live larvae producers’ that we set each night individually in pitchers that are designed to flow into a ‘larvae trap’. Federica and I set the colonies in their pitchers and arranged the traps and water flow in each around 7pm local time. The idea is that it gets too hot for them to be in the small pitchers during the heat of the day, and you need to wait until it cools down to transfer them. They will release larvae sometime in the night between midnight and 6am. At 7am, we will remove the colonies from the pitchers and give them more ‘breathing room’ in the large blue tank and cover it with a shade cloth to keep the brooders cool and happy. Fingers crossed there are a few larvae to show for it all in the traps tomorrow morning!

##### Sunday 06/12/2022

Continued to clean out to insides of the tanks in the early morning, then spent the rest of the day with family in Honolulu. My Uncle and Auntie picked me up at 10AM at Lilipuna pier, and I stayed at my Auntie's apartment with my Dad overnight.

##### Monday 06/13/2022

Uncle dropped me back off at Lilipuna pier by 8AM, and I caught the ferry over to HIMB! I spent the morning looking for my Mason Jars (I found them in room 105, right next to the dive locker in the ‘new old poly’ lab building), emailing about potential purchases (HOBO loggers) and picking up two more packages (The dissecting scope and camera from Amazon!) from Ku’ulei. I worked to set up the second microscope and camera. I downloaded camera software from Amscope, but could not find the driver software because all the links to the drivers on the Amscope webpage were broken. I called Amscope customer service, but got a voicemail. I spent a good part of the day attempting to drill my 2.5" holes into the bottoms of the glass Mason Jars, with lots of stuggling with the battery-powered dewalt drill not having enough juice to get through even 1 or 2 jars before needing to re-charge. I called Jackie and asked for permission to buy a nicer corded drill that would help me get the job done faster, and she agreed to the purchase. I joined Dr. Ku’ulei Rodgers and her lab members for lunch at the picnic table near the point lab. They invited me to help them measure reef rugosity at Hanauma Bay when it would be closed Monday June 20th in observance of Juneteenth. I told them I'd love to go, but that it would depend on what I ended up doing once Jackie arrived. After lunch I made aa quick run to the City Mill hardware store, where I got a ride from Kama in the shuttle van from Lilipuna pier and back. I bought a Makita corded drill (my new favorite lab equipment!) I spent the following couple of hours happily drilling 2.5in diameter holes in the bottom of 16 Mason Jars using my pre-made wood hole guide, and two other jars as a make-shift stand. The corded drill worked like a charm! I made sure to keep the cutting tool edge in contact with the glass wet to reduce overheating. The broken glass was collected in a bucket along with rinse water. I strained out the water and placed the broken glass in a cardboard box, taped it up, labelled it 'broken glass' and tossed it in a dumpster. 

##### Tuesday 06/14/2022 

> Super Moon!

- ToupView software + drivers, uninstalled Amscope software.

- Today I finally turned the water on! Water is flowing through 6 blue tubs.

Juneteenth observed federal holiday

At 0800 I helped Federica move *P. acuta* colonies from pitchers and clean larvae traps. Hardly any larvae (basically none)  Jackie, Callum and I made plans to meet for an orientation snorkel at 0930. 

##### Tuesday 06/21/2022

##### Sunday  07/03/2022

I woke from a very restful night at my Auntie and Uncles house that I'll attribute to the cooler temperatures in Palolo valley and the black-out curtains in the spare bedroom. I met up with Jill and Federica at the Lilipuna pier (they had taken the 10AM shuttle boat across), and we drove together to the Kaneohe Pancake House for a late brunch. After macadamia nut pancakes, crepes, a strawberry waffle, spam, and lots of coffee, we had a plan for enjoying some 4th of July festivities and  getting in a few fun dives before our time drew to a close. After brunch we went to City Mill and Jill and Federica helped me find the right PVC adaptor and brass barbed coupling pieces to setup my glass settlement chambers with individualized tubing that runs to each chamber via a manifold. We then drove to Westside Dive & Tackle in Kailua, a free dive and spearfishing specialty shop, where I got new 4mm dive socks that were thinner and more flexible to wear with my dive fins compared to the 7mm boots that rubbed my pinky toes raw. I also got a new mask, snorkel, whetstone, and a net that looked like it was made for catching underwater butterflies (how could I resist?). We made it back to the Lilipuna pier for the 2PM shuttle boat. Back on Moku O' Lo'e, I assembled the new manifold with one trial chamber setup. We geared up for a snorkel and returned the *P. acuta* colonies that we had collected with Ariana Huffmyer on 06/11/2022. Federica picked out 13 fresh colonies with high hopes that they would pop out brooded larvae, we shuttled them back to a blue tub for a night of acclimation. I rinsed gear, showered, and sat down to read more 'Pollution is Colonialism' by Max Liboiron. Around 7PM  I read " ...CLEAR no longer uses chemicals that require hazardous waste disposal, because hazardous waste disposal assumes access to Land as a sink." pg. 135, chapter 3, An Anticolonial Pollution Science, and my eyes went big as I registered that I had forgotten to move the *P. compressa* histology fragments from the z-fix paraformaldehyde to 70% ethanol 48hrs after collection. I leapt up and headed straight to the lab to collect supplies for the transfer (70% ethanol, squirt bottle, gallon ziploc, 50mL falcon tubes for waste, large forceps to hold back coral fragments as I poured out the z-fix, nitrile gloves, and a mask) into a carboard box, then headed to the Coral Resilience Lab hood and set to work transferring all the z-fix into 50mL falcon tubes, caping them tightly, and placing those all together in a ziploc bag, labeling it 'z-fix: FSW, 1:4, haz waste'. I brought everything back down to lab 112, placing the z-fix waste bag under the sink in temporary storage and the *P. compressa* histology fragments in upright racks on the top shelf above the lab bench. Callum must have some 6th sense, because just as I finished up he texted me asking how things went with swapping the z-fix for 70% ethanol. I had to share the bad news about my mess-up, leaving the fragments in z-fix for 103hrs instead of the 48hrs listed in the protocol. I ended the day by emailing Jackie the same bad news. I know that I can go collect new fragments if I need to, but I also know that Jackie wanted the fragments as early as possible to improve the chances of seeing whether the fragments were male or female. I really hope I didn't ruin that objective. I feel awful for forgetting, especially after I re-assured Callum and Jackie that I had it on my calendar and that I wouldn't forget!

##### Thursday 08/04/2022

 

##### Friday 08/05/2022

- Picked up Putnam-Lab dry shipper with Callum from UH main campus, it was still full of LN2 from the day before!
- Prepped cryovials for flash freezing the ambient environmental baseline of  *M. capitata* samples from 10 genetically distinct colonies for later omics and microbiome analysis
- Dr. Jackie Padilla-Gamiño collected 10 *M. capitata* colonies for the phthalate and temperature multiple stressor acute exposure experiment from the  southeastern corner of Coconut Island (entered water at the small beach between the Maturation Building (aka Coral Resilience Lab) and Hale Hinalea)
- Dr. Jackie Padilla-Gamiño, Callum Backstrom, and I did some housekeeping at the racks. I scraped *P. compressa* cow tags of algae, Callum collected samples for metals, Jackie cleared *M. capitata* racks of excess growth
- Clipped ~3cm fragments from each colony, Jackie moved them into cryovials, capped them tightly, and dropped them into liquid nitrogen in a small thermos. We brought the thermos of liquid nitrogen and samples to the -80 freezer, and transferred them to a wax freezer box (using long forceps to get vials out of liquid nitrogen) 
- Stayed late to begin the pool party test trial. The objective of this trial is to see how long a small fragment of coral can last in a closed 20mL mesocosm with increasing phthalate exposure.  For the planned experiment, we also hope to have temperature as a multiple stressor factor.

- Cleaned and returned all 16 2gal aquariums to Dr. Ku'ulei Rodgers (this took 2.5hrs!)
- Assessed coral after 15hr exposure
- Cut at least 14 2cm fragments and 14 3cm fragments from each of the 10 *M. capitata* colonies collected Friday 08/05/2022, set on egg-crate racks to acclimate until experiment start (this took 3hrs!)

To cut coral fragments I setup a driftwood board workbench over a tank with a ruler to measure 2cm and 3cm fragments of *M. capitata*, attempting to make as few 'pruning' trims as possible, and checking that each fragment would fit in a 20mL vial. I used the small bone cutters and 70%ethanol between working with each colony. Setting the 2cm fragments on the egg crate is a little tricky because the length between cross-pieces is just about cm, so the fragments rest perfectly across one square, or if they're a little short or nudged, they fall through the egg crate.

- Drove Jackie to the airport, added Callum to the rental car 

- Wandered the  Aloha Stadium swap meet for souvenirs and lunch!

- Unboxed Apex EL, connected to WiFi, daisy chained PM's and connected temp probes

  

  Ended the day by visiting my Auntie for dinner :) 

##### Monday 08/08/2022

- Programmed Apex EL with code modified from Ariana Huffmyer and Jill Ashey, details can be found in apex-el.setup.md
- Could not fix error with data logging, opened a help ticket with Apex customer support
- Quick visual check of day 3 pool party test, most fragments were still looking good. 

Today was a slog of troubleshooting Apex! I worked in the lab from 8AM to 4PM straight, and succesfully programmed the Apex with 16 virtual outlets that controlled 4 real outlets. Despite the fact that the temperature probes were responding to changes in temp ( when I held a probe in my hand, temp would increase from room temp to body temp ), the graphs in the Apex fusion site would not populate with logged data. I reset the clock, rebooted the Apex, re-connected to WiFi and to the Network directly via an ethernet cable. I spent hours reading Apex documentation and troubleshooting posts. 

Frustrated, I took a short break and cleaned out a tank. Callum helped me move *F. scutaria* and *M. capitata* to the tank across from the acclimating fragments. 

We departed HIMB around 6PM.  

##### Tuesday 08/09/2022

- Found that Apex EL unit has a manufacturer defect of a bad SD card, stuck in the year 2013. This prevents data logging because the Apex system only displays temp data from the last 3 months.
- Assessed day 4 of pool party test, 5cm and 3cm fragments decaying. Concluded maximum length of pool party experiment should be no more than 3 days, and using 2cm fragments. 
- Cleaned and flipped 4 large blue tubs
- Cleaned all glass settlement chambers and set to dry
- Began cleaning food-safe containers 
- Purchased heat-seal bags at Target for Callum to ship samples in TEM/ethanol 

Started the day fresh digging into more troubleshooting the Apex's no data logging issues. I called Miranda, who was in Seattle troubleshooting the JPG-Lab Apex system in the Portage Bay Building. She was able to confer with Nuria, and both gave me some advice on how to attempt downloading the data logs. 

Then, Neptune Systems customer support finally called! I spoke with Kyle who instructed me to reset the clock timezone once again, and reboot the Apex. This did not fix the problem. Kyle then remoted into my desktop and used command prompt to access the backend programming of the Apex, and found that the unit's SD card was stuck thinking the year was 2013. This revelation, as frustrating as it was, kind of made me relieved because it was a manufacturer defect that was not my fault. I shutdown the Apex system, unplugged the Apex EL brain, and packed it for shipment. Kyle indicated the cross-ship could be to HI within a day or two via next-day air. 

After cleanup and poll-party test assessment, Callum and I ran to Target to get some heat seal bags for shipping TEM/ethanol preserved samples. 

Finished the day with burgers and beers at Maui Brewing! 

##### Wednesday 08/10/2022

- Sent in Apex EL RMA
- Watched Corinne's Masters defense!
- Reached out to Katy Shaw about shadowing methods density separation device
- Cleaned cambro food-safe containers, totes for storage, extension cords

Neptune Systems customer support finally sent me the instructions for getting the return label for the fubar Apex EL brain. I filled it out first thing.  Callum and I talked about our plans for the next few days to pack and clean as much as possible, and send the samples to URI in the dry-shipper as soon as Wesley can get back to the UH campus to pass Emma's samples to us (fingers crossed that it's tomorrow or the day after).

##### Thursday 08/11/2022

- Called Apex, got replacement unit upgraded to overnight shipment

- Returned excess TEM solution to Tina at UH

- Shipped Jill Ashey's 3 mesh bags of samples in Putnam lab dry shipper via FedEx priority overnight, due to arrive at URI on Monday Aug 15th

- Drafted email to Francesco Saliu about delaying PAE collections

  We attempted to also ship Emma's samples, and coordinated with Wesley and met with him at UH with the dry shipper, however the samples would not fit, and we decided it was safest to send Jill's samples as one shipment. Removing the samples from the mesh bag did not significantly decrease the space the samples took up in the shipper. It's likely best to keep samples in mesh bags in the future. 

  Called and talked with Jill Ashey, who will send the Putnam shipper back to HI on Monday, and we're crossing our fingers that it will arrive by Wednesday or Thursday next week. We will not use the shipper to freeze cryovials, just send them back to UW.

  

##### Friday 08/12/2022

- Got permission from Ford to use FSW and chemical hood for Sunday night

- Got permission from Mike to borrow some LN2 to freeze cryovials from pae-temp experiment

- wrote up data sheet for pae-temp experiment

  Messaged with Jill Ashey, who indicated they're in no rush to send Emma's samples back. This may mean that we're off the hook for coordinating the return of Emma's samples to URI.
