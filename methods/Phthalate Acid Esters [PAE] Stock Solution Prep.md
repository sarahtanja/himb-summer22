# Acute plasticizer exposure to *Montipora capitata* egg-sperm bundle crosses

## Project Overview

Plasticizers are a suite of chemicals added to plastic consumer products to increase flexibily. The most widely used plasticizers are phthalate acid esters (PAEs). 



I exposed coral embryos and larvae to phthalates in filtered seawater and assess any toxic effects on the survival and development of the coral embryos. This experiment will be conducted in closed-system 20mL scintillation vials with foil-lined caps. 



#### Materials

- 1mL of [EPA 506 phthalate mix , 500$\mu$g/mL in methanol](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/product/supelco/48223) (keep refrigerated)

Glassware

- 6, 1L reagent bottle for stocks, baked at 500$\degree$F  (260$\degree$C) for 1hr
- 1, 1000mL graduated cylinder for measuring out fsw

Pipettes & Tips

PPE

- safety glasses (wear 'em!)
- nitrile gloves
  - From correspondence with UW EH&S Occupational Safety and Health practitioner Ann Tu:
    -  "NIOSH has a PPE guide: https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/publications/osha3151.pdf and I only see two types of phthalates listed, "dibutyl phthalate" and "diocytl phthalate" on page 26 (printed on book) of the guide and looks like **nitrile** gloves would work for both. "
- Chemical hood (ventilation ON!)
- If you do not have access to a fume hood, use a respirator with P95 cartridges
  - From correspondence with UW EH&S Occupational Safety and Health practitioner Ann Tu:
    - "I used the 3M Respirator selection guide to look for the appropriate mask to protect against inhalation of phthalates [https://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/639110O/3m-respirator-selection-guide.pdf?fn=Respirator%20Selection%20Guide%20Final](https://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/639110O/3m-respirator-selection-guide.pdf?fn=Respirator Selection Guide Final). Looks like **P95** would work for all the phthalates listed in the guide which includes all the above except benzyl butyl phthalate and di-n-octyl (they have di-sec-octyl which is the same as bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate."

#### Safety Considerations

Please review the [SDS](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/sds/supelco/48223) for EPA 506 phthalate mix, 500$\mu$g/L in methanol before working with this chemical!

Hazard statements:

-  H225 Highly flammable liquid and vapor 
-  Toxic if swallowed, in contact with skin or if inhaled
-  Causes damage to organs (Eyes, Central nervous system)

This chemical is toxic and can absorb through skin, and vaporize and be inhaled. **WEAR GLOVES, SAFETY GLASSES, &  MASK. WORK UNDER A HOOD!** *If you are pregnant, consider alternatives like preparing leachate similar to Tetu et. al 2020*

#### Phthalates

I used the [EPA 506 phthalate esters mix 1](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/product/supelco/48223?gclid=CjwKCAjw-8qVBhANEiwAfjXLrp8fD-G8yiB_NyrA3OLy3r2jdylgBmHVPUfGFnMp4CMfuVwePGi1dxoCBQIQAvD_BwE), which comes as a 1mL ampule vial with a glass break-off cap. It includes 6 common phthalates each at a concentration of 500$\mu$g / mL, *(500,000$\mu$g/L)* .

The mix contained the following 6 phthalates:

- Benzyl butyl phthalate **(BBP)**

- Bis(2-ethylhexyl) adipate **(DEHA)**

- Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate **(DEHP)**

  - listed on EPA's Toxics Release Inventory (TRI)

  - DEHP is regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act. The highest concentration allowed, the maximum contaminant level (MCL), is 0.006 mg/L , **(6$\mu$g/L)**


- Dibutyl pthalate **(DBP)**
  - listed on EPA's Toxics Release Inventory (TRI)


- Diethyl phthalate **(DEP)**

- Dimethyl phthalate **(DMP)**

Based on this review, I chose to doses at the following concentrations:

- 0$\mu$g/L : control
- 0.5$\mu$g/L (0.0005$\mu$g/mL): environmentally relevant value

- 5$\mu$g/L (0.005$\mu$g/mL) : would be considered just under acceptable drinking water

- 50$\mu$g/L (0.05$\mu$g/mL) : increasing by factor of 10
- 150$\mu$g/L (0.150$\mu$g/mL): max environmental relevance (Jebara et al. 2021, in Tunisia @ 168$\mu$g/L)
- 500$\mu$g/L (0.500$\mu$g/mL): an overdose above environmental relevance to be used as a positive control

**Doses may be graphed best on a log scale x axis



### Dilution Plan

Concentration 1 multiplied by volume 1 is equal to concentration 2 multiplied by volume 2.
$$
C_1V_1 = C_2 V_2
$$
The EPA standard mix is 500$\mu$g/mL (or also 500,000$\mu$g/L). This is our known concentration. We also know our desired diluted concentration, and the volume we need. Here we solve for $V_1$, to find out how much of $C_1$ we need to add to filtered seawater make the total end volume $V_2$.



### Prepare phthalate stock solutions in 1L reagent bottles

Final volume of stock solutions must be enough to use in subsequent serial dilutions and in sample vials over the course of three nights of spawning. Stock solutions must be kept between -3C to -8C in a chemical storage refrigerator (same as the EPA standards mix).

### Prepare treatment 20mL scintillation vials

Using a 20mL serological pipette, pipette 19mL from the desired stock concentration into the 20mL scintillation vial. Label vial lids with treatment concentration. 

### Collect egg-sperm bundles and perform bundle-bundle crosses

On spawning night, collect genetically disparate bundles and cross them (2 bundles per vial)

### Count cleavage percentage 4-hours post fertilization 

Set vials floating in a flow-through water bath, using diced pool floats. Let sit for 4 hours. After 4 hours, eggs should be broken up from the bundles and floating at the surface of the scintillation vial. Use a transfer pipette to move the eggs from the vial to a petri dish, and photograph all eggs from each treatment vial through an Amscope connected to a dissecting microscope. 

Make sure to accurately name each photo jpeg file to reflect the treatment it came from. Work quickly and randomize the treatments you photograph. This part is very time consuming and will take 10 or more minutes per vial until you get the hang of it and start to work a bit faster (4-5 minutes per vial).
