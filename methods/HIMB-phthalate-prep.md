# Phthalate Acid Esters [PAE] Dosing

I will expose coral embryos and larvae to phthalates in filtered seawater and assess any toxic effects on the survival and development of the coral embryos. This experiment will be conducted in closed-system 20mL scintillation vials with foil-lined caps. 

Additionally, along with my advisor Dr. Jackie Padilla-Gamino, and Callum Backstrom, we will expose *Montipora capitata* egg-sperm bundles to phthalates and microbeads briefly during fertilization in 24-well plates, then collect and freeze the samples at -80C for later transcriptomics analysis.  

## Phthalates

I used the [EPA 506 phthalate esters mix 1](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/product/supelco/48223?gclid=CjwKCAjw-8qVBhANEiwAfjXLrp8fD-G8yiB_NyrA3OLy3r2jdylgBmHVPUfGFnMp4CMfuVwePGi1dxoCBQIQAvD_BwE), which is a 1mL vial that includes 6 common phthalates each at a concentration of 500$\mu$g / mL, *(500,000$\mu$g/L)* .

The mix contained the following 6 phthalates:

- Benzyl butyl phthalate **(BBP)**

- Bis(2-ethylhexyl) adipate **(DEHA)**

- Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate **(DEHP)**

  - listed on EPA's Toxics Release Inventory (TRI)

  - DEHP is regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act. The highest concentration allowed, the maximum contaminant level (MCL), is 0.006 mg/L , **(6$\mu$g/L)**


- Dibutyl pthalate **(DBP)**
  - listed on EPA's Toxics Release Inventory (TRI)


- Diethyl phthalate **(DEP)**

- Dimethyl phthalate **(DMP)**

Based on this review, I chose to dose the coral gametes and larvae at the following concentrations:

- 0$\mu$g/L : control
- 0.5$\mu$g/L (0.0005$\mu$g/mL): environmentally relevant value

- 5$\mu$g/L (0.005$\mu$g/mL) : would be considered just under acceptable drinking water

- 50$\mu$g/L (0.05$\mu$g/mL) : increasing by factor of 10
- 150$\mu$g/L (0.150$\mu$g/mL): max environmental relevance (Jebara et al. 2021, in Tunisia @ 168$\mu$g/L)

**Doses will be graphed on a log scale x axis

### Dilution Plan

Concentration 1 multiplied by volume 1 is equal to concentration 2 multiplied by volume 2.
$$
C_1V_1 = C_2 V_2
$$
The EPA standard mix is 500$\mu$g/mL (or also 500,000$\mu$g/L). This is our known concentration. We also know our desired diluted concentration, and the volume we need. Here we solve for $V_1$, to find out how much of $C_1$ we need to add to filtered seawater make the total end volume $V_2$.

#### Materials

- 1mL of [EPA 506 phthalate mix , 500$\mu$g/mL in methanol](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/product/supelco/48223)
- 5L of 1-micron filtered seawater (fsw) in autoclaved glass (more than enough)

- 1, 1000mL graduated cylinder for measuring out fsw
- 1, stereological 5mL pipette
- 6, stereological 5mL pipette tips
  - 1 for ea. concentration of phthalate, fsw & HPLC water
- 1, 1mL pipette and tips
- 1, 20-200$\mu$L p200 pipette and tips
- 

### Prepare stock solutions

Final volume of stock solutions must be enough to use in subsequent serial dilutions and in sample vials over the course of three nights of spawning. Stock solutions must be kept between -3C to -8C in a chemical storage refrigerator (same as the EPA standards mix).
