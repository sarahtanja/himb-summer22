# Phthalate Acid Esters [PAE] Stock Solution Prep

I will expose coral embryos and larvae to phthalates in filtered seawater and assess any toxic effects on the survival and development of the coral embryos. This experiment will be conducted in closed-system 20mL scintillation vials with foil-lined caps. 

Additionally, along with my advisor Dr. Jackie Padilla-Gamino, and Callum Backstrom, we will expose *Montipora capitata* egg-sperm bundles to phthalates and microbeads briefly during fertilization in 24-well plates, then collect and freeze the samples at -80C for later transcriptomics analysis.  

## Phthalates

I used the [EPA 506 phthalate esters mix 1](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/product/supelco/48223?gclid=CjwKCAjw-8qVBhANEiwAfjXLrp8fD-G8yiB_NyrA3OLy3r2jdylgBmHVPUfGFnMp4CMfuVwePGi1dxoCBQIQAvD_BwE), which is a 1mL vial that includes 6 common phthalates each at a concentration of 500$\mu$g / mL, *(500,000$\mu$g/L)* .

The mix contained the following 6 phthalates:

- Benzyl butyl phthalate **(BBP)**

- Bis(2-ethylhexyl) adipate **(DEHA)**

- Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate **(DEHP)**

  - listed on EPA's Toxics Release Inventory (TRI)

  - DEHP is regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act. The highest concentration allowed, the maximum contaminant level (MCL), is 0.006 mg/L , **(6$\mu$g/L)**


- Dibutyl pthalate **(DBP)**
  - listed on EPA's Toxics Release Inventory (TRI)


- Diethyl phthalate **(DEP)**

- Dimethyl phthalate **(DMP)**

Based on this review, I chose to dose the coral gametes and larvae at the following concentrations:

- 0$\mu$g/L : control
- 0.5$\mu$g/L (0.0005$\mu$g/mL): environmentally relevant value

- 5$\mu$g/L (0.005$\mu$g/mL) : would be considered just under acceptable drinking water

- 50$\mu$g/L (0.05$\mu$g/mL) : increasing by factor of 10
- 150$\mu$g/L (0.150$\mu$g/mL): max environmental relevance (Jebara et al. 2021, in Tunisia @ 168$\mu$g/L)

**Doses will be graphed on a log scale x axis

PPE

- safety glasses (wear 'em!)
- nitrile gloves
  - From correspondence with UW EH&S Occupational Safety and Health practitioner Ann Tu:
    -  "NIOSH has a PPE guide: https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/publications/osha3151.pdf and I only see two types of phthalates listed, "dibutyl phthalate" and "diocytl phthalate" on page 26 (printed on book) of the guide and looks like **nitrile** gloves would work for both. "
- Chemical hood (ventilation ON!)
- If you do not have access to a fume hood, use a respirator with P95 cartridges
  - From correspondence with UW EH&S Occupational Safety and Health practitioner Ann Tu:
    - "I used the 3M Respirator selection guide to look for the appropriate mask to protect against inhalation of phthalates [https://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/639110O/3m-respirator-selection-guide.pdf?fn=Respirator%20Selection%20Guide%20Final](https://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/639110O/3m-respirator-selection-guide.pdf?fn=Respirator Selection Guide Final). Looks like **P95** would work for all the phthalates listed in the guide which includes all the above except benzyl butyl phthalate and di-n-octyl (they have di-sec-octyl which is the same as bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate."

#### Safety Considerations

Please review the [SDS](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/sds/supelco/48223) for EPA 506 phthalate mix, 500$\mu$g/L in methanol before working with this chemical!

Hazard statements:

-  H225 Highly flammable liquid and vapor 
-  Toxic if swallowed, in contact with skin or if inhaled
-  Causes damage to organs (Eyes, Central nervous system)

This chemical is toxic and can absorb through skin, and vaporize and be inhaled. **WEAR GLOVES, SAFETY GLASSES, &  MASK. WORK UNDER A HOOD!** *If you are pregnant, consider alternatives like having someone else prepare these dilutions*.

### Dilution Plan

Concentration 1 multiplied by volume 1 is equal to concentration 2 multiplied by volume 2.
$$
C_1V_1 = C_2 V_2
$$
The EPA standard mix is 500$\mu$g/mL (or also 500,000$\mu$g/L). This is our known concentration. We also know our desired diluted concentration, and the volume we need. Here we solve for $V_1$, to find out how much of $C_1$ we need to add to filtered seawater make the total end volume $V_2$.



### Prepare stock solutions

Final volume of stock solutions must be enough to use in subsequent serial dilutions and in sample vials over the course of three nights of spawning. Stock solutions must be kept between -3C to -8C in a chemical storage refrigerator (same as the EPA standards mix).

###### [ ] PEAK:  Make 1000mL of 150$\mu$g/L using EPA standard mix

$$
500\mu g(V_1)=0.150\mu g(1000mL) \\
V_1= \frac{0.150\mu g (1000mL)}{500 \mu g} \\
V_1 = 0.3

$1000mL - 0.3mL = 999.7mL$ : volume of filtered seawater to add to 1000mL reagent jar  *(Do this via graduated cylinder, then add via p200 pipette)*

$0.3mL = 300\mu L$  : volume of EPA standard mix to add to 1000mL reagent jar to attain end volume of 1000mL *(use p200 pipette)*
