# Experimental setup for plastic leachate treatments

## How to build a leachate infuser chamber





Stainless steel is very difficult to drill because it is so hard. The trick with stainless steel is using very slow speed and low pressure. The problem with stainless steel is that it work hardens at fairly low temperatures, meaning that it the act of drilling stainless can actually make it even harder than it was before. Once it is work hardened, you are never going to get through. You can literally melt a high speed steel bit on work hardened stainless and never get a hole in the material.
