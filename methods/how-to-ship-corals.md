# How to ship corals



## Live



## Frozen

There are two options for shipping frozen coral samples :  using a liquid nitrogen (LN2) dry-shipper, or using dry-ice and a quality cooler.  Both of these methods should keep samples *frozen*, not just cool. Factors to consider when choosing which method to use include what materials you have access to, and how long samples have to be in transit.
