# M. capitata Spawn Timeline

Montipora capitata mass spawning will take place on or near the night of the new moon in the summer months, especially in June and July, which are considered “peak” spawning months. In order to maximize gamete collection:

- Observe spawning on the day before, day of, and day after the new moon.

- The peak of spawning events usually occurs at approximately 9pm.

  ### LOGISTICS 

  The logistical challenges of collecting gametes are best met with the following preparations and considerations:
  ● Access to spawning “slicks” - the masses of floating gametes released by Montipora capitata - is best from a motorized boat.
  ● Gametes will float past an anchored boat on the leeward (downwind) side of patch reefs.
  ● Collection will require direct access from the boat to the water’s surface.
