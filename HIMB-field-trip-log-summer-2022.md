> Daily Tips: HIMB Lilipuna parking and pier gate code is 3246. Apparently it’s always the same 4 numbers, but they switch the order up occasionally. 

I departed Seattle and arrived in Honolulu with 2 bags of personal gear, 1 large husky tote, and 1 small dry-shipper. The husky tote weighed 75lbs, and was over the 50lb limit. The Alaska Air fee for overweight gear was $70. The tote and dry-shipper were both considered ‘oversized’. I was surprised at the airport by my Dad and Auntie, who fit all of the gear in the back of a Subaru Crosstrek and took me to get a poke bowl at Nico's on pier 38! I later went grocery shopping at Foodland in Kāne'ohe and my Dad dropped me off to make a rendezvous at the Lilipuna parking lot and pier with Ariana Huffmyer and Jill Ashey from the Putnam Lab. After a brief kerfuffle trying to find the right gate code, we all loaded the gear up on the ‘ferry’ (a 14ft skiff!) driven by an RA, and motored over to HIMB. I dropped personal gear and groceries in my dorm room at the Hinalea, and dropped lab gear in the newly renovated Pauley lab 112a&b. I ended the day with a brisk walk around the island, unpacked my bags, and stashed my groceries in one of the Hinalea fridges.

> Daily Tip: The low vine ground cover near the blue tanks has stinging nettles! Wear garden gloves when pruning… 

I started the day by assessing the tanks, shelter frame, and tank platform. One tank was already in use to grow algae, the other 15 were upside down and covered in old leaf litter. Of note was the rusting condition of the shelter frame, which had lost a corner vertical pole entirely, leaving a rusty joist angled down near face-level which we nicknamed the ‘tetanus spear’. I learned that the sand filter for the water was broken, and the water coming through the pipes was raw from the bay. Ariana, Jill, and I then spent a sweaty hour generally cleaning up the place. Fritz, one of the lead facilities managers, lent us a leaf blower, large pruning shears, and a pair of broad push-brooms. We discovered many of the cinder blocks used to prop up the blue tanks had been ‘repurposed’ (stolen, some may say). There were 36 cinder blocks missing. We had enough cinder blocks to set up 6 tanks (enough for the Putnam Lab’s needs) and enough PVC elbow connectors to set up stand-pipes for drainage, but we needed more. Once 6 tanks were up and water was flowing, I continued to push-broom the remainder of the platform and weed and prune back the overgrowth from the invasive mangroves that were encroaching on the tank platform and shelter. We also visited the ‘creepy-closet’ and recovered the JPG-lab gear stored there, moving it all to the ‘new old poly’ lab 112. We ended the day with a short trip to Kailua for a swim!

> Daily Tip: HIMB facilities managers arrive at 7am and wrap up their workday at 2pm. 

Started the day by walking over to the workshop near the lighthouse to talk to HIMB facilities staff Fritz about the cinder blocks. He said that they didn’t have any that were unused, and encouraged me to buy some from City Mill hardware store in Kāne'ohe. He told me I could go to the office to check out the white HIMB truck parked at Lilipuna to go get them (spoiler alert, I can’t because I’m not a UH employee and the UH insurance doesn't extend to visiting researchers).  Instead, I was introduced to my HIMB sponsor Ku’ulei at her lab on the point. She ushered me inside and made me feel very welcome and was extremely kind and generous. She arranged to have her research technician Andrew pick me up in his personal truck and take me to City Mill. We hand loaded all 36 cinder blocks into the back of his Tacoma PreRunner! I forgot to eat breakfast, so I treated us both with some poke bowls for an early lunch. After, we met Fritz, Troy, and Luke at the He’eia Kea Boat Harbor. They had brought over the landing craft vessel and a forklift to pick up some other shipments, and we were able to time it Troy, talking about Alaska and boats the whole way. Once back at HIMB, they used the forklift to bring the pallet of cinder blocks right to the tank platform, where I set them out and spray-painted them with a little JPG-Lab marker. Federica arrived today! Ariana picked her up from the airport while I was out dealing with the cinder blocks. Jill’s large FedEx shipment of equipment also arrived. I helped shuttle gear back and forth from the lighthouse to the lab, and I ended the day by catching up on this log, and submitting some receipts for reimbursement.
